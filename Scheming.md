The question is, what metrics are we looking for exactly? Starting easy with selling price of USD/BTC and GBP/BTC and maybe 24 hr trade volume. Trade book would be cool to see how fast IO stream can get. Maybe one of these can be used for benchmarking for some kind of speed test to test our progress??
